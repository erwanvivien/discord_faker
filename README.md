# faker_bot
A simple fake bot for discord

This is kind of my worst code...

I feel some pain still while reading this $@~# file ðŸ¤£

## What it does.
It's a parody/impersonate bot, you type in ``fake "name" message is here`` and it will grab the username that matches the most the ``"name"`` 
in your discord and will grab his avatar and send ``message is here`` there are many more possibilities

- ``fake`` ``name`` ``message with any amount of spaces``: Send the message as name, if someone matches that name on the discord, it takes it's avatar
- ``fake`` ``"name with spaces"`` ``message``: Same as above for names with spaces in it.
- ``fake`` ``id_discord`` ``message``: Will 100% grab the image of the guy with that ID and it's name
- ``fake`` ``name`` ``message`` ``url``: Will fix the name to ``name`` and use the image you provided as ``url``, any image

## Possibilites
- ``fake 289145021922279425 Hey it's me, the dev of the app`` (it takes my username and profile picture)
- ``fake "zac efron" Hey it's Zac Efron, how are ya'll ?? ðŸ¤ª`` (it only takes zac efron's name)
- ``fake "zac efron" Hey it's Zac Efron, how are ya'll ?? ðŸ¤ª http://www.gstatic.com/tv/thumb/persons/286896/286896_v9_ba.jpg`` (it takes Zac Efron's name and any picture you gave)

## Why ?
Why not ?

## Is this legal ?
I haven't done many research but I believe it is as there will ALWAYS be [BOT] tag before the message and also it will be blank (which is a wierd role on discord, ngl)
